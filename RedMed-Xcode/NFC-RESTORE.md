# NFC Tag Reading

CoreNFC write/read is wired in production (`NFCWriter` / `NFCReader`). Simulator
cannot do real NFC — on Simulator / when `readingAvailable` is false the UI
shows an error and does **not** fake a successful link.

## Portal / signing checklist

1. Developer portal → App ID `com.redmed.app` → enable **NFC Tag Reading**
2. Xcode → Signing & Capabilities → **Near Field Communication Tag Reading**
3. Confirm `RedMed.entitlements` has `com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.formats` = `NDEF`
4. Confirm `Info.plist` has `NFCReaderUsageDescription`
5. Device test: write band → second phone Safari tap → emergency card

Free Apple Developer teams cannot ship the NFC entitlement — paid Program required.
